Used by Floflis to identify an insiders build

[![Screenshot](screenshot.png)][repo]

## Changelog
See the list of changes on Github:  [https://github.com/FloflisPull/buildmark/commits/master][commits].

## Issues
If you find any bug you can file an issue in the Github project page: [https://github.com/FloflisPull/buildmark/issues][issues].

Make sure you have an updated version of Cinnamon and try to explain the more detailed you can what the problem is (don't just say _"it doesn't work"_ because that doesn't help at all).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, also to remove useless functions such as custom watermarks/prebuilt icons.
